This is a working library for graphics.h used in old old c++ applications which has little to no support today. 
winbgi.h saved me from using turboC7 rather than an IDE in which I have the luxury or exiting out of my running program.

The orginal file was over 300mb, could not upload here. The missing files are bgi.sdf and the following folders:
.vs
Debug
ipch

These I have uploaded to my drive, if anyone needs it message me
